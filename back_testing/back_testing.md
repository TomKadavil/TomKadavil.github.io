# Back testing 

Backtesting means the process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to assess its accuracy.
Though, no funds are invested in reality. Backtesting is based on the phenomenon that, the strategy
which performed well in the past, is expected to work well in the future. 

Backtesting allows a trader to simulate a trading strategy using historical data to generate results and analyze risk and profitability before risking any actual capital. As long as a trading idea can be quantified, it can be
backtested. 

Typically, this involves a programmer coding the idea into the proprietary language
hosted by the trading platform.

We employ statistical modelling such as 

    - Regression 

    - Clustering 

    - PCA , principal component analysis 


Recently with the advent of Neural Networks and deep learning . I came accross a couple of papers that seem to indicate the use of such kind of techniques to be employed in the purpose of predictions .
